# 1. Projective Geometry Problems

## (a) Prove that parallel lines in the world reference system are still parallel in the camera reference
system.

pf) Define a line in the CRS(camera reference system) to be 3-dimensional plane that pass through $A’_1=[x’_1, y’_1, 1]$ and $A’_2=[x’_2, y’_2, 1]$. Then the parallel planes are defined to be 2 planes such that $\overrightharp{A_1 A_2}$ and $\overrightharp{B_1 B_2}$ are parallel. In WRS case, parallel can be defined in exactly the same way. That is,

$$
(A^1_i-A^2_i)_{i=1,2,3}=k(B^1_i-B^2_i)_{i=1,2,3}
$$

for some real $k$.

Performing projective transformation yields the following.

\\(

\mathbf{K}\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{R}&\mathbf{T}\end{bmatrix}\begein{bmatrix}A^1\\\ 1\end{bmatrix}

\\)

## (b) Consider a unit square $pqrs$ in the world reference system where p, q, r, and s are points. Will
the same square in the camera reference system always have unit area? Prove or provide a
counterexample.

## (c) Now let’s consider affine transformations, which are any transformations that preserve par-
allelism. Affine transformations include not only rotations and translations, but also scaling
and shearing. Given some vector p, an affine transformation is defined as

$$
A(p) = Mp + b
$$

## where $M$ is an invertible matrix. Prove that under any affine transformation, the ratio of
parallel line segments is invariant, but the ratio of non-parallel line segments is not invariant.

## (d) You have explored whether these three properties hold for affine transformations. Do these
properties hold under any projective transformation? Justify briefly in one or two sentences
(no proof needed).
