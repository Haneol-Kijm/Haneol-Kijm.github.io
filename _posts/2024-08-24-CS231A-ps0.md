Actually, for checking out clearer output, refer to the follwoing [Google Colab jupyter notebook output](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uNJOGvm9MaOtz6bN1X3Mnr-KQiNuUKmO?usp=sharing).

## 1. Basic Matrix/Vector Manipulation (20 points)
In Python, calculate the following by filling out p1.py. Given matrix M and vectors a,b,c such that
\\(
M =\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\\4&5&6\\\7&8&9\\\0&2&2\end{bmatrix}, a =\begin{bmatrix}1\\\1\\\0\end{bmatrix}, b =\begin{bmatrix}−1\\\2\\\5\end{bmatrix}, 
c =\begin{bmatrix}0\\\2\\\3\\\2\end{bmatrix}
\\)  

(a) Define Matrix $M$ and Vectors $a,b,c$ in Python using Numpy.  
```
M, a, b, c = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],[0,2,2]]), np.array([[1],[1],[0]]), np.array([[-1],[2],[5]]),np.array([[0],[2],[3],[2]])
```
(b) Find the dot product of vectors a and b (i.e. $a^\top b$).  
```
aDotb = np.dot(a.T, b)
```
(c) Find the element-wise product of a and b $\[a_1b_1, a_2b_2, a_3b_3\]^\top$.  
```
aProdb = np.multiply(a, b)
```
(d) Find $(a^\top b)Ma$.  
```
result = np.dot(a.T, b) * np.dot(M, a)
```
(e) Without using a loop, multiply each row of $M$ element-wise by a. **Briefly explain the logic of your code in your written report.**  
Making use of broadcasting
```
tile = np.tile(a.T, (M.shape[0], 1)) # broadcasting a
newM = np.multiply(M, tile)
```
(f) Without using a loop, sort all of the values of the new $M$ from (e) in increasing order and plot them in your report.  **Briefly explain the logic of your code in your written report.**  
Making use of sorting
```
sortedM = np.sort(M, axis=None)
```

## 2. Basic Image Manipulations (40 points)
Do the following by filling out p2.py:  
(a) Read in the images, image1.jpg and image2.jpg, as color images using io.imread from the skimage package. 
```
img1, img2 = io.imread('./image1.jpg'), io.imread('./image2.jpg')
```
(b) Convert the images to double precision and rescale them to stretch from minimum value 0 to maximum value 1.   
```
def normalize_img(img):
    return (img-np.min(img))/(np.max(img)-np.min(img))
```
```
img1, img2 = img1.astype(np.double), img2.astype(np.double)
img1, img2 = normalize_img(img1), normalize_img(img2)
```
(c) Add the images together and re-normalize them to have minimum value 0 and maximum value 1. **Save and include this image in your report.**   
```
sumImage = img1 + img2
sumImage = normalize_img(sumImage)
```
(d) Create a new image such that the left half of the image is the left half of image1 and the right half of the image is the right half of image2. **Save and include this image in your report.**   
```
assert img1.shape==img2.shape, '2 images do not have same shape'  # MxN in grayscale, MxNx3 in color image
newImage1 = np.zeros_like(img1)
newImage1[:, img1.shape[1]//2:] = img1[:, img1.shape[1]//2:]
newImage1[:, :img1.shape[1]//2] = img2[:, :img2.shape[1]//2]
```
(e) Using a for loop, create a new image such that every odd numbered row is the corresponding row from image1 and the every even row is the corresponding row from image2 (Hint: Remember that indices start at 0 and not 1 in Python). **Save and include this image in your report.**   
```
assert img1.shape==img2.shape, '2 images do not have same shape'  # MxN in grayscale, MxNx3 in color image
newImage2 = np.zeros_like(img1)
for i in range(img1.shape[0]//2):
    newImage2[2*i+1, :] = img1[2*i+1, :]
    newImage2[2*i, :] = img2[2*i, :]
```
(f) Accomplish the same task as part e without using a for-loop (the functions reshape and tile may be helpful here). **Briefly explain the logic of your code in your written report.**   
```
assert img1.shape==img2.shape, '2 images do not have same shape'  # MxN in grayscale, MxNx3 in color image
newImage3 = np.zeros_like(img1)
newImage3[1::2, :] = img1[1::2, :]
newImage3[::2, :] = img2[::2, :]
```
(g) Convert the result from part f to a grayscale image. **Save and include the grayscale image in your report.**   
```
grayVec = np.array([0.299, 0.587, 0.114])
grayImage = np.dot(img, grayVec)
print(grayImage.shape)
```

## 3.Singular Value Decomposition (40 points)
Do the following by filling out p3.py:  
(a) After reading in image1 as a grayscale image (this is done for you in the code already) take the singular value decomposition of the image.  
```
u, s, v = np.linalg.svd(img1)
v = v.T
```
(b) Recall from the discussion section that the best rank n approximation of a matrix is $\sum_{i=1}^n u_i \sigma_iv_i^⊤$, where $u_i$, $\sigma_i$, and $v_i$ are the $i$th left singular vector, singular value, and right singular vector respectively. **Save and include the best rank 1 approximation of the (grayscale) image1 in your report.**  
```
def low_rank_approx(rank, u, s, v):
    # we recommend you implement this helper function for parts b and c
    rankapprox = np.zeros((u.shape[0], v.shape[0]))
    for i in range(rank):
        ui=np.expand_dims(u[:, i], axis=-1) 
        vi=np.expand_dims(v[:, i], axis=-1)
        rankapprox += s[i]*np.dot(ui, vi.T)
    return rankapprox
```
```
rank1approx = low_rank_approx(1, u, s, v)
```
(c) **Save and include the best rank 20 approximation of the (grayscale) image1 in your report.**
```
rank20approx = low_rank_approx(20, u, s, v)
```
